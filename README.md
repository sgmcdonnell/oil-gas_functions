2) The <b>Test_Pad_Prod</b> function will return a time vs production plot for multiple wells and type curves. It is different from padprod in that it normalizes production to the type curve, and it plots wells by color scheme according to their input groups.

3) The <b>2 category bar chart</b> will create a bar chart comparint two sets of costs- budget to actual. For example, I use this code to compare our completion and drillout actual costs to the budget.
