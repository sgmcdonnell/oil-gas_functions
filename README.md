Oil and Gas Functions


This repository contains functions useful in the oil and gas industry.


1) The <b>padprod</b> function will return a time vs production plot for multiple wells and type curves.

2) The <b>2 category bar chart</b> will create a bar chart comparint two sets of costs- budget to actual. For example, I use this code to compare our completion and drillout actual costs to the budget.

3) The <b>DJ Gun Barrel</b> function is a quick way to plot diagrams of wellbores with relative spacing in formation and to each other.
