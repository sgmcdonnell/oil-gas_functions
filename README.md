This repository contains function useful in the oil and gas industry.


1) The <b>padprod</b> function will plot production given a DataFrame where the x input is the date (or days producing) and they input is the production feature of the DataFrame. 

2) The <b>2 category bar chart</b> will create a bar chart comparint two sets of costs- budget to actual. For example, I use this code to compare our completion and drillout actual costs to the budget.

3) The <b>DJ Gun Barrel</b> function is a quick way to plot diagrams of wellbores with relative spacing in formation and to each other.
